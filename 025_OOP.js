/*
Object Oriented Javascript
- a bit different from OOP with other languages
- an object describes an entity, it can model the real world
- constructor function same as classes in JS
- but diff syntax
- this in constructor function (ctor)
- ctor does not return anything >
- use new keyword to create a new instance
- and assign it to a new variable
